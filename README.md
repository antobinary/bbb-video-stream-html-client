# bbb-video-stream-html-client

Some attempts to show a BigBlueButton video stream in an html with a standalone Flash player.

Just open `index.html` and try it!

## Important!

In Flash Player's security model, Flash applications and SWF files on a local computer cannot access the network.
So first you need disable this security option for the files in your local folder.

To do so, go to the [Flash Security Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html) and add your local folder to the list.
